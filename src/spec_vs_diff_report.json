  "summary": "Implemented a dedicated PublicThemeProvider that forces light mode and wrapped public portfolio, initializing, and unauthenticated/login UI branches with it. However, the diff for authenticated routes is truncated, so it’s not fully verifiable that authenticated theme behavior remains unchanged. Some additional project metadata/documentation files were modified/added that were not requested by the BuildRequest.",
